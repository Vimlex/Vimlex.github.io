<h1>Vimlex / a swedish legal tech startup.</h1>
<p>It all began when two of the four founders, Olle and Ludvig, met at law school in Uppsala, Sweden, while working part time for a large nordic insurance company. The two did some in-house software development to improve the workflow efficiency, database search and statistics tracking. They quickly realized that they enjoyed working together and complemented and reinforced each other, since Ludvig had a background in economics and experience from running a successful company while Olle had a more tech-oriented background.</p>

<p>Since they also shared visions and ideas for how the practice of law could be reimagined and both wanted to work together towards reinventing the way legal services are delivered, they began working on some projects of their own. Realizing that they wanted to focus on the legal tech field, they joined forces with the DevOps sysadmin/web developer Kevin and data scientist/engineer Johanna.</p>

<p>The group took a big leap ahead when it enrolled in Uppsala Innovation Centreâ€™s (UIC) business incubator for tech startups, <a title="Business Agile" href="http://www.uic.se/en/uic-programs/uic-business-agile/" target="_blank">Business Agile</a>, where they got lots of valuable experience and advice on how to deliver customer value quickly and follow the Agile and Lean development methodologies.</p>

<p>Today, Vimlex is mainly focused on developing legal web services, especially in the fields of machine learning and document automation expert systems such as <a title="avtalsguiden.se" href="http://avtalsguiden.se" target="_blank">avtalsguiden.se</a> (a document automation service for contracts), but is also offering legal advice for tech startups and consultancy for law firms who want to modernize and stay ahead of the curve in the legal service sector.</p>

<p>Even though our main focus lies within the legal tech area we keep a pragmatic approach towards entering new business areas where we believe we can use our business knowledge and development experience to create value. In these cases the Vimlex group have a flexible attitude and if needed create partnerships with dedicated competent persons outside the group to execute projects. A great example of this approach is Vimlex latest project <a title="Little Inkfinger" href="http://littleinkfinger.com" target="_blank">littleinkfinger.com</a>.</p>
